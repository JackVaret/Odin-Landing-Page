This project is one to demosntrate a basic understanding of formatting a webpage using html, css, and flexbox.
By the end of it, I will have demonstrated an understanding of how to divide the formatting of a webpage into various segments, how to align those segments correctly and how to ensure that said alignment remains constant on various devices and window screens.

Current Progress/Thought Process:
Create a simple HTML barebone for the Page, starting from top to bottom. Then, create divs around various sections to segment the content into its four major sections.
